# Wine is Mine üá´üá∑üç∑

A web application to query tastes from wine enthusiasts, and fetch a selection of great wines from our catalog.
Currently using Together AI's free endpoint for consuming Llama 3.3.

## Features

- Server-side processing with Node.js
- Static file serving for frontend assets
- LLM integration for intelligent transformation of user input into filters
- Function call to Supabase for querying best wines
- Scoring based on user's preferences and WIM notes
- Data storage all in Supabase

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- Supabase
- Wine data :) 

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with required environment variables

```
TOGETHER_API_KEY=xx
SUPABASE_URL=xx
SUPABASE_KEY=xx
```

## Development

To run the development server (nodemon used for hot reload):

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Vercel. The `vercel.json` configuration handles:
- Node.js server deployment
- Static file serving
- Route configurations

To deploy:
1. Install Vercel CLI
2. Install environment variables in Vercel settings
3. Run `vercel --prod` in the project root

## Demo

All feedback welcome.

## Known issues

- Llama 3.3 randomly outputs a malformed native function call in its content instead of a regular tool call. Happens 1 out of 5 times. Moving away from Llama to e.g Gemini should make it more stable.

## Wine Selection Logic üçá

Our selection process works in 3 clear phases:

1. **Initial filtering**  
   We first look for up to 20 wines that may match :
   - Preferred regions (e.g. Burgundy/Provence)
   - Specific appellations (e.g. Meursault)
   - Favorite domains/ch√¢teaux
   - Price range preferences

   If the initial search resulted to less than 10 wines, or if the connoisseurs let us broaden their horizons, we expand the search without filters - except for price.

2. **Scoring**  
   Each wine earns points based on:
   - **Color priority**: 4x points for 1st choice color, 3x for 2nd, etc, with a factor of 10
   - **Taste match**: Matches wine characteristics to user preferences  
     *(e.g. "Fruity reds" get boosted if user prefers fruity flavors)*
   - **Quality score**: Wine is Mine internal rating (note_wim) gives bonus points, with a factor of 5

3. **Final selection**  
   - up to 20 potential matches are identified
   - These are re-ranked by total score
   - Final selection shows the 10 highest-scoring wines

This ensures recommendations balance personal preferences with best in class wines.
